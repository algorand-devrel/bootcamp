### Install
Open a new terminal window and navigate to your desired install directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/algorand/sandbox
cd sandbox
```

### Starting a local private Algorand network

> :information_source: **Recommended**
> Most developers should begin their development process using a local private network. See later section for starting and syncing with a public Algorand network.

```
./sandbox up dev -v
```

Sandbox in _dev mode_ provides the following infrastructure components:

| Tool | Description | 
| ---- | ----------- | 
| `algod` | ledger nodes |
| `goal` | CLI tool + transaction builder |
| `kmd` | wallet (key manager) | 
| `indexer` | blockchain queries | 

> :information_source: **Notice**
> `indexer` is **not** provided when Sandbox is started on a _public_ Algorand network. User a third-party API provider in this mode.

#### Default Accounts
Sandbox running as a _local private network_ provides three (3) default accounts when the network is initialized. You may view these accounts at anytime using the following command: 
```
./sandbox goal account list
```
Sample output:
```
[online]    QYL3G7H63N3JUH6LUX3LPHWOW6AT2XYQ6GD4E3OP7KBTFKWXGTF7FW3VM4  QYL3G7H63N3JUH6LUX3LPHWOW6AT2XYQ6GD4E3OP7KBTFKWXGTF7FW3VM4  4000000000000000 microAlgos
[online]    RCJBNCQOMRBBBDG4TEVOYKUQMCFMLZ2RUWBQP3HARYBJRH5YBYRP52MFKI  RCJBNCQOMRBBBDG4TEVOYKUQMCFMLZ2RUWBQP3HARYBJRH5YBYRP52MFKI  4000000000000000 microAlgos
[online]    457AGKGZUM5QC5ESLXMGL5YD3I2A7MJDRNPYFBHKJ3PGLZMS4SQYXQBMOE  457AGKGZUM5QC5ESLXMGL5YD3I2A7MJDRNPYFBHKJ3PGLZMS4SQYXQBMOE  2000000000000000 microAlgos
```

> :information_source: **Notice**
>These pre-funded accounts are stored within the default wallet maintained by `kmd`

Set environment variables for default account addresses for CLI usage:
```
ADDR1=$(./sandbox goal account list | awk 'FNR==1{ print $2 }')
ADDR2=$(./sandbox goal account list | awk 'FNR==2{ print $2 }')
ADDR3=$(./sandbox goal account list | awk 'FNR==3{ print $2 }')
```

Display an account _Balance Record_ using:
```
./sandbox goal account dump --address $ADDR1
```

#### First Transaction
Send your first transaction using the `goal` CLI tool:

```
./sandbox goal clerk send --amount 123456789 --from $ADDR1 --to $ADDR2
./sandbox goal account dump --address $ADDR1
```

> :information_source: **Notice**
>the `--amount` flag specifies the unit of microAlgos. 1 ALGO is 1_000_000 microAlgo.

#### Query Confirmed Transactions
Use `curl` to query the Indexer for all transactions:
```
curl "localhost:8980/v2/transactions?pretty"
```

## REST APIs

### algod node
Sandbox provides `goal` as the primary CLI tool for building, signing and sending transactions. SDKs provide clients to `algod` for accessing [REST APIs](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/algod/v2/) using:

- Address: `http://localhost:4001` 
- Token: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`

### KMD wallet
Sandbox provides `kmd` the _key management daemon_ for storing private keys and signing transactions. SDKs provide clients for accessing [REST APIs](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/kmd/) using:

- Address: `http://localhost:4002` 
- Token: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`

> :information_source: **Notice**
> `goal` will automatically start `kmd` when requesting transaction signing. SDK clients must ensure `kmd` is running to successfully access the REST APIs.

### Indexer
Sandbox provides `indexer` as the primary query tool for committed blockchain data. SDKs provide clients for accessing [REST APIs](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/indexer/) using:

- Address: `http://localhost:8980`

> :information_source: **Notice**
> A _token_ is not required

## Syncing to Public Algorand Network(s)
Sandbox may be used to connect to the public Algorand `BetaNet` or `TestNet` or `MainNet` for deployments and limited testing. Sandbox is not supported for production infrastructure environments. Connect to `TestNet` using:
```
./sandbox up testnet -v
```
> :information_source: **Notice**
> The Indexer is not provided when Sandbox is started connected to a public network.

## SDKs
Algorand provides SDKs in four languages:
- [Python](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/sdks/python/#install-sdk)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/sdks/python/#install-sdk)
- [Java](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/sdks/java/#install-sdk-for-runtime)
- [Go](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/sdks/python/#install-sdk)

[Algorand Community supported SDKs](https://developer.algorand.org/ecosystem-projects/?tags=sdk) are avilable in many additional languages.

### Install Python SDK
Open a new terminal window.
```
pip3 install py-algorand-sdk
```

## Account Generation

Open 1-acount_generation.py

```
from algosdk import account, mnemonic

def generate_algorand_keypair():
    private_key, address = account.generate_account()
    print("My address: {}".format(address))
    print("My private key: {}".format(private_key))
    print("My passphrase: {}".format(mnemonic.from_private_key(private_key)))

generate_algorand_keypair()
```
### Account balance

Open 2-account_balance.py

#### Create KMD client and connect to default wallet
```
# define sandbox values for kmd client
kmd_address = "http://localhost:4002"
kmd_token = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
kmd_client = kmd.KMDClient(kmd_token, kmd_address)

# connect to default wallet
wallet = Wallet("unencrypted-default-wallet", "", kmd_client)
```

#### Create algod client
```
# define sandbox values for algod client
algod_address = "http://localhost:4001"
algod_token = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
algod_client = algod.AlgodClient(algod_token, algod_address)
```

#### Check balance
```
# check account balance
account_info = algod_client.account_info(addr1)
print("addr1 balance: {} microAlgos".format(account_info.get('amount')) + "\n")
```

> :information_source: **Notice**
> Before sending transactions to the Algorand network, the account must be funded to cover required transaction fees. Use the [Algorand TestNet Dispenser](https://dispenser.testnet.aws.algodev.network/). â€‹

### Payment transaction

Open 3-payment_transaction.py

#### build unsigned transaction
```
params = algod_client.suggested_params()
receiver = addr2
note = "Hello World".encode()
amount = 1000000
unsigned_txn = transaction.PaymentTxn(addr1, params, receiver, amount, None, note)
```

#### sign transaction
```
signed_txn = unsigned_txn.sign(wallet.export_key(addr1))
```

#### submit transaction
```
txid = algod_client.send_transaction(signed_txn)
print("Successfully sent transaction with txID: {}".format(txid))
```

## Account Info
Open 4-account_info.py

## Asset Creation (ASA)
Open 5-create_asset.py

```
unsigned_txn = AssetConfigTxn(sender=addr1,
        sp=params,
        total=10000,   # Fungible tokens have total issuance greater than 1
        decimals=2,    # Fungible tokens typically have decimals greater than 0
        default_frozen=False,
        unit_name="FUNTOK",
        asset_name="Fun Token",
        manager=addr1,
        strict_empty_address_check=False,
        reserve="",
        freeze="",
        clawback="",
        url="https://path/to/my/fungible/asset/metadata.json",
        metadata_hash="", # Typically include hash of metadata.json (bytes) 
)
```
### Asset Optin
By default the creator account is optin to hold the asset, all other accounts must make an asset optin transaction for each asset they desire to hold.

Open 6-assest_optin.py

```
# build unsigned transaction
params = algod_client.suggested_params()
sender = addr2
index = 2   # ensure this matches the asset-index returned by asset_create.py 
unsigned_txn = transaction.AssetOptInTxn(sender, params, index)
```

## Atomic Transactions
Atomic transactions enforce execution of a defined set of ordered transations will either all succeed, else no state transitions will persist upon failure of any transaction therein. Typically used in asset swaps and smart contract calls.

### Swap ALGO for FUNTOK
Open 7-atomic_transaction.py

#### build unsigned payment transaction

```
params = algod_client.suggested_params()
sender = addr2
receiver = addr1
amount = 1000000
txn_1 = transaction.PaymentTxn(sender, params, receiver, amount)
```

#### build unsigned asset transfer transaction
```
sender = addr1
receiver = addr2
amount = 100 # remember this ASA has 2 decimal places, so this is 1.00 FUNTOK 
index = 2   # ensure this matches the asset-index returned by asset_create.py 
txn_2 = transaction.AssetTransferTxn(sender, params, receiver, amount, index)
```

##### group transactions
```
gid = transaction.calculate_group_id([txn_1, txn_2])
txn_1.group = gid
txn_2.group = gid
```

#### sign transaction
```
stxn_1 = txn_1.sign(wallet.export_key(addr2))    
stxn_2 = txn_2.sign(wallet.export_key(addr1))
```

#### assemble transaction group
```
signed_group = [stxn_1, stxn_2]
```

#### submit atomic transaction group
```
txid = algod_client.send_transactions(signed_group)
```
